My name is Shannon. This is my living portfolio. I made that term up, it mostly means a blog about whatever I'm working on.

The reason I'm doing this is because these projects are in process. I'm doing my best to make them real, so that my design capabilities are clear, and so that you have a sense of my process and how I think. I have some nasty NDAs locking down my portfolio, so I'm getting off my ass and making things.

I'll also be fixing this thing up as I go along. I'm just learning how to work with Jekyll, so bear with me. I'm working with the Fragile development process. That means anything could break at anytime and everything is subject to change.

So, welcome. Poke around and see what I've been up to lately. I have a [static portfolio](http://icandothisjob.shannonmiwa.com) if you're interested.
