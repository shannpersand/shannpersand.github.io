##Instruments in the Cloud
There's this project that I've been itching to fix, ever since I worked on it. I've always seen a lot of potential in this thing, but because of budget and time constraints, plus an incomplete understanding, I never got involved the way I should have.

You can read a bit about the initial steps of the project [here](http://designdesigndesign.shannonmiwa.com/design.html). And [Instruments in the Cloud](http://www.instrumentsinthecloud.org) will give you a sense of the program.

If that's tl;dr for you, then here's the short version:

Instruments in the Cloud is a digital instrument management tool for schools, teachers and students. I was introduced to the project after the completion of the website. My role was to do front end development for a web-wrapped mobile application.

The project has long since launched, but I'm documenting my process of redesigning the entire thing.
