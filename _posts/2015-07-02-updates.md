If you're wondering why there's been a gap here, it's because I had to spend some time driving over to California. I don't know why anyone would wonder that.

Anyway, now that I'm somewhat settled, I'm spending some time doing the Harvard CS50 computer science online course and trying to wrap my head around react.js. I may post occasionally with the CS project assignments, since that's some valid work.  But, I'm not going anywhere, still plugging away at this stuff. I'm hoping to get to a point where I can use react.js on my prototype bits, just to learn how it works etc.

I'm updating and pushing to something inbetween wireframes and a prototype.

[This Thing](http://instruments.shannpersand.com) is going to be chipped away at and modified until eventually it reaches a point where a backend dev could take over. I'm using Intuit as my base and getting back into SCSS. It'll slowly be revised with content and visuals so that eventually it's some sort of interactive production comp.

Why am I jumping into code? Because I want to! I'll continue using Sketch for the app wireframes for now, and maybe throw them up on InVision, but the web stuff I'm just going to start sketching in code. Why not? I want to see what the challenges are and see how it can translate.

Besides, I'm only on CS5 and I sure as hell am not going to pay for CC by myself. Trying to evolve my process away from Photoshop.
