##Crap.

Ok, hang on. This is getting circular, and without users/client direction it's a bit tricky deciding certain things. I'm writing up a little brief about the program and what the general goals/functions are just to get a better sense of the *why*. Also, need to answer larger questions such as 'Why even create an app? Why not just an awesome responsive website?'

The existing site, isn't responsive, and a lot could be done to develop a more seamless experience between app and web. There's definitely a marketing aspect to the site, but the admin site should actually match the app. There will be schools without access to mobile devices for management, so it would be ideal to democratize that as much as possible using the website. Or maybe you can also donate a tablet device in addition to instruments...?

Sketching.

Furrowing brow.

Hmm. It seems like I need to step back even further and really suss out who needs what, and why. Jotted down a bit of an overall story to sort things out.

###General Story
The program allows for individual schools to track their instruments [The Catalog]. This means they have a good view of their inventory, they should be able to get a large overall picture of their catalog as well as a granular view of individual instrument details.

In addition to tracking instruments, schools are able to acces other schools' catalogs. Instruments in the network are able to be shared/checked out. Because of the organized nature of the app, there are options in place to ensure that the right schools have the right amount of instruments for their students and that the right students have the right instruments.

There are periods of time for borrowing to allow for equal access to instruments. There is not only an organizational aspect, but also a community aspect to the program.

The website, along with the app helps organize the admin's catalog of instruments. It also allows communications between various admins, whether they are from the same school or from other schools. There is a student/user version of the app/website so that students can log in and track the use of their chosen instrument. There are engaging student features such as tracking practice time, rating instruments, things that encourage interest in music along with helping the admin keep track of the instrument, can an app encourage responsibility and create interest in music? It may be necessary for the student access to be limited to web viewing, but a good solid web experience that is mobile oriented.

There should be a community aspect not only for the different schools, but also for the different students.

Donations occur through the web portal. Needs for verification of donations, timing, placement, who gets what.
