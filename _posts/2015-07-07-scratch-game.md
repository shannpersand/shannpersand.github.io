##Scratch Game

I made a game! Wheeee. Pretty much my first computer game, it's always exciting to do a first like this. Some basic computer science stuff going on, but it's definitely made things clearer for me, filling in some low level js holes I've had forever.

[Doughnut Catcher](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/69284754/) is a simple game I composed for the first problem set of the CS50 Harvard run edx course. I'm not going for the certificate, but doing all the assignments is going to be the best way to learn, so I figured I'd post them here, too.
