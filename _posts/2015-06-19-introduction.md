##Why, what?
Let's cut to the chase. I'm trying to get a job, here.

The problem is that I've got a bit of a roadblock on my portfolio. I've got NDAs swarming all over it and really naught to show as far as UI/UX/Web/App stuff goes.

I've gotten some feedback that I need to show more of what I'm capable of, design-wise. I'm having a hard time getting the message across that I don't think designing for print is so much different from designing for web, or apps, or software or any other type of design that's out there. It all comes from the same core.

Well, so what? So I've been chipping away at this old project that I did front end development for. I had some issues with the design, but didn't have the ability to design it, so the result was a better but still not awesome product.

I can't change what I did, but I can show what I would like to do. I started redoing the project, picking up the pieces and trying to use it as a springboard to showcase my design process.

Turns out, it's a shit-ton of work. I'm probably not going to have it done anytime soon, because each little knot I undo leads to about a million more questions, and since the project is over, there aren't any resources for me to revisit. So I decided to log my steps in this journal, and hey, learn how to spin up Jekyll while I'm at it.

This thing is the record of a re-work in progress. I don't know when it will end or if it will end, well, I hope it ends with me getting a jobâ€”maybe from you!

Thanks for reading.
